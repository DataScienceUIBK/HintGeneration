The course of the A1 has changed where towns or villages have been bypassed and where new alignments have taken a slightly different route [^1^]. Several sections of the route have been upgraded to motorway standard and designated A1 (M) [^1^].\n\nThe Great North Road was one of the main routes from London to Scotland and became part of the A1 road [^3^].
